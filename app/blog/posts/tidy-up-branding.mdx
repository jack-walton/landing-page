Over the last week, I made some minor enhancements to the user interface of this website. I added some images and metadata to both `jackwalton.xyz` and `help.jackwalton.xyz`. I also updated the microcopy in the `Search` component of the help pages.

## Icons

I updated the `icon` metadata for `jackwalton.xyz` to display a custom shortcut icon in web browsers:

```
icons: {
    icon: '/icon.png',
    shortcut: '/icon.png',
},
```

This change will ensure that browser tabs and bookmarks display a custom icon.

I created `icon.png` in Figma. I experimented with using a logo that I had designed. But I want this website to mostly focus on prose style and typography, so I went with something simpler.

I have been listening to a lot of [Gesaffelstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesaffelstein) as I've been coding this website. I took inspiration for `icon.png` from the cover of [Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Gesaffelstein_album)), which is a solid, black block. I decided to do something similar:

I picked the color, `#a19595`, out of the style sheet from this website to ensure that it harmonizes with the rest of the current design.

## Social preview

I also added `images` metadata (the "twitter card") so that the website would have a preview image when people share it on social media or in text messages:

```
images: [{
    url: 'https://jackwalton.xyz/thumbnail.png',
    width: 1200, // Updated to recommended size
    height: 630, // Updated to recommended size
    alt: 'Jack Walton',
    type: 'image/png',
}],
```

For the social preview image, I continued with the minimalistic approach I took with the `shortcut` icon. I took inspiration from the Los Angeles Apparel social preview image:

I created something in the same vein. Again, I used `#a19595` for the color and I used the Geist font so that the typography would harmonize with the rest of the website:

I also made a version of this card for the `help.jackwalton.xyz` subdomain:

## Microcopy

In [a previous post](./open-source), I mentioned that I couldn't figure out how to update the placeholder text in the `Search` component in `help.jackwalton.xyz`. I figured it out. My main problem was that I tried to import the component from the wrong library. The corrected code looks more like this:

```tsx
import {Search} from 'nextra/components'

//...

const search = (
    <Search placeholder={"Search the help pages"}/>
)

//...

export default async function RootLayout({children}) {
    return (

        //...

        <Layout
            
            //...

            search={search}

            //...

        </Layout>

       //...
    )
}
```

With this update, I changed the placeholder copy for the search bar in the Help Pages from "Search the documentation..." to "Search the help pages." I think this is a slight improvement in tone. And it's a bit more accurate too. The word "documentation" implies something more technical than a simple help page.
